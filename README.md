# Ageing Signs Detection using Deep Learning

## Project Overview
This project explores visual detection and classification of age-related facial signs using deep learning models. By processing facial images and applying convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the goal is to identify patterns or features commonly associated with aging—such as wrinkles, pigmentation, or puffy eyes; across a labeled dataset.


## Tools & Technologies
- Language : Python 3.x
- Libraries : numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, opencv-python, tensorflow, keras
- Vision : OpenCV (image reading and resizing), Matplotlib (image display)
- DL Framework : TensorFlow/Keras (CNN implementation)

## Features
- Preprocessing of facial images for model input
- CNN-based image classification to detect aging signs
- Visualizations for dataset inspection and model performance
- Potential applications in health-tech, skincare, and biometrics

## Workflow

Step 1) Dataset Preparation
- Load and label facial images categorized by visible signs of aging
- Apply resizing, normalization, and augmentation if needed

Step 2) Data Exploration
- Visualize sample images
- Understand class distribution and balance

Step 3) Model Development
- Build a CNN using Keras layers (Conv2D, MaxPooling, Flatten, Dense)
- Use ReLU and softmax activations for feature extraction and classification

Step 4) Training and Validation
- Train the model on training set
- Monitor loss and accuracy using validation set

Step 5) Evaluation
- Plot confusion matrix, classification report
- Visualize predictions on test images
